	<p>
    Ville Sommet sits atop the border of Tagaytay and Alfonso, Cavite. With undulating hillocks and towering pine trees, 
    not only is it the perfect backdrop four Erik and Marian's wedding, but also the ideal destination for a quick yet
    magical getaway. Here is the place of possibilities as it transforms from being your very own secret garden in the
    day into a scene of your favorite romance novel at night.

  <p>
    Love lives here.
